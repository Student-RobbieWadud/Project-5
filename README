This is my README file.

My Git repository is https://github.com/Student-RobbieWadud/Project-5.git

This project has 5 files: the makefile, queue.h, shared.h, user.c, and oss.c

The make clean does not clean everything for some reason.

Also, I get a segmentation fault when I try to run the code as correctly as I can (could not fix it).
